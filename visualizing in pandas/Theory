Line Graph: A line graph, also known as a line chart, is a graphical representation that displays data as a series of points connected by straight lines. It is commonly used to show the relationship between two variables and how they change over time.
Line graphs are particularly useful when analyzing and presenting data that has a continuous or sequential nature. They are often used to illustrate trends, patterns, or fluctuations in data over a specific period. The x-axis (horizontal axis) represents the independent variable, typically time, while the y-axis (vertical axis) represents the dependent variable being measured.
